This project was taking a dataset of stocks and pulling different pieces of information from that. 

I had issues coming from two spots in my code. 

For one, when I made my code I used the dataset alphabet_testing, which worked quite well. However, after importing that to the bigger dataset I would get errors of overflow

This messed with my yearly change columns on the second sheets.

Secondly, my percentage change only worked for the adjacent ticker, not the ticker it was assigned to, something I could not figure out. I also had the same overflow message as yearly change.

In total, I had no problems with the Ticker column, as well as greatest increase/decrease for the values that did get assigned, as well as the conditional formatting.
